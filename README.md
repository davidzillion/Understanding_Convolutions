# Understanding_Convolutions

(f \text{*} g)(t) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(\tau)g(t - \tau)\tau'

(f \text{*} g)(t)	=	functions that are being convoluted
t	=	real number variable of functions f and g
g(\tau)	=	convolution of the function f(t)
\tau'	=	first derivative of g(tau) function

In mathematics, convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it.

Convolution is an orderly procedure where two sources of information are intertwined; it's an operation that changes a function into something else. Convolutions have been used for a long time typically in image processing to blur and sharpen images, but also to perform other operations.
